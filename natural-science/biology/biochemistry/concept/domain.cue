    A *protein domain* is a distinct, independently folded, stable structural unit
    within a polypeptide chain that typically folds autonomously, retains its
    characteristic three-dimensional structure even when separated from the rest
    of the protein, and often performs a specific biochemical or functional role
    (e.g. binding, catalysis, localization).

    - *$β$ barrel* is a single domain of $α$-hemolysin ($α$-溶血素, a toxin that
      kills a cell by creating a hole in its membrane) from the bacterium
